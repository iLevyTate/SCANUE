Welcome to the SCANUE repository! This project focuses on creating a Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network ([SCAN](https://github.com/iLevyTate/SCAN)) using Experts/ User Extensible and web-based technologies to replicate and enhance prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions for decision-making, problem-solving, and planning.

## Overview

SCANUE aims to develop AI-based extensions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The project focuses on creating AI agents that simulate the functions of various PFC regions to assist in real-time cognitive tasks. The agents are built using Experts.js and other web technologies.

### Name Change Notification

We have rebranded from SCANJS to SCANUE due to SCANJS being a deprecated project created by another developer. If "SCANJS" appears in documentation, code, or other references, this was prior to the name change.

## Features

- **Cognitive Augmentation**: Simulate and enhance PFC functions for improved cognitive tasks.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilize multiple specialized AI agents for different cognitive tasks.
- **Web-Based**: Built using JavaScript and deployable as a web application.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Easily extendable to include more cognitive functions and agents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iLevyTate/scanue.git
cd scanue
npm install
```

### Running the Project

To run the project locally:

1. **Set up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

2. **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Example Usage

After running the project, you can interact with the cognitive agents through the web interface. Enter text input for analysis and receive synthesized responses from the AI agents.
